    <h2>January Holidays</h2>
    <h3>January 1 - New Year’s Day</h3>
    <p>What Do People Do?
    Many Filipino people unite on New Year’s Eve, which is on December 31, to celebrate a midnight meal known as the Media Noche. It is also common to stay awake to greet the coming of the New Year. New Year’s Day is also characterized by Filipinos lighting fireworks and making a lot of noise to drive away evil spirits. This belief originated from the Chinese.
    <br>
    <br>
    The elderly encourage children to jump at the stroke of midnight so that they would grow up tall. Many people display 12 circular fruits and wear clothing with polka dots to symbolize money. It is also popular practice to open all the doors and windows at the stroke of midnight to let in the good luck. Many Filipino families also read the Christian bible and attend a church midnight mass. It is common for many Filipinos to blend religion and superstition in celebrating New Year’s Day.
    <br>
    <br>
    Public Life
    <br>
    <br>
    New Year’s Day is a public holiday in the Philippines on January 1. Government offices, schools and most businesses are closed. Public transport is limited to reduced bus and jeep services operating during New Year’s Day.
    <br>
    <br>
    Background
    The New Year’s Day/New Year’s Eve celebrations start on December 31 and continue through to January 1. New Year’s Day in the Philippines is short but uniquely celebrated throughout the country. This is also the time of the year when many Filipino families get together and strengthen their family ties. New Year’s Day in the Philippines is a joyful holiday that is characterized with the intermarriage of religion and paganism which are the attributes of a once Hispanic Philippine Society.
    <br>
    <br>
Symbols
Filipinos symbolize New Year’s Day with their visions of how the start of the New Year opens opportunities for a bountiful life. This is the reason why the Filipino dining table which is the focal point of this holiday in that the table is abundant with food that comes in round or circular shapes to represent money. Fireworks also symbolize driving away bad luck during New Year’s Day.</p>

    <h2>April Holidays</h2>
    <h3>April 7 – Araw ng Kagitingan </h3>
    <p>
      The Day of Valor, officially known as Araw ng Kagitingan, is a national observance in the Philippines that commemorates the fall of Bataan and the Resistance in Corregidor against Japanese troops during World War II. The day is officially celebrated every April 9, the start of the Bataan Death March, although the date was moved on several occasions to avoid it from coinciding with the observance of the Holy Week in the country, especially the Easter Triduum and Easter Sunday, such as in 2004, 2009, 2020, and 2023.[1][2][3]
      <br>
      <br>
      Due to Bataan's significance in World War II, the holiday was officially known as Bataan Day or Corregidor Day prior to the 2000s and is still known under this name by others. In the United States, the holiday is celebrated in Maywood, Illinois, where it is referred to by its old name.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>April 8 – Maundy Thursday</h3>
    <p>
      "Holy Thursday" redirects here. For other uses, see Holy Thursday (disambiguation).
      <br>
      <br>
      Maundy Thursday, also referred to as Holy Thursday, or Thursday of the Lord's Supper, among other names,[note 1] is a Christian feast during Holy Week that marks the beginning of the Paschal Triduum, and commemorates the Washing of the Feet (Maundy) and Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Apostles, as described in the canonical gospels.[1]
      <br>
      <br>
      It is the fifth day of Holy Week, preceded by Holy Wednesday (Spy Wednesday) and followed by Good Friday.[2] "Maundy" comes from the Latin word mandatum, or commandment, reflecting Jesus' words "I give you a new commandment."[3] The date of the day will vary according to whether the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar is used. Eastern churches generally use the Julian system.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>April 9 – Good Friday</h3>
    <p>
      Good Friday, also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday, or Friday of the Passion of the Lord,[1][2] is a solemn Christian holy day commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary (Golgotha). It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum.
      <br>
      <br>
      Members of many Christian denominations, including the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, Oriental Orthodox, United Protestant and some Reformed traditions (including certain Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches), observe Good Friday with fasting and church services.[3][4][5] In many Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Methodist churches, the Service of the Great Three Hours' Agony is held from noon until 3 p.m.—the hours the Bible records darkness covering the land until Jesus' death on the cross.[6] In the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican traditions of Christianity, the Stations of the Cross are prayed in the evening of Good Friday, as with other Fridays of Lent.[7] Communicants of the Moravian Church have a Good Friday tradition of cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries.[8]
      <br>
      <br>
      The date of Good Friday varies from one year to the next in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars. Eastern and Western Christianity disagree over the computation of the date of Easter and therefore of Good Friday. Good Friday is a widely instituted legal holiday around the world.[9] Some predominantly Christian countries, such as Germany, have laws prohibiting certain acts—public dancing, horse racing—in remembrance of the sombre nature of Good Friday.[10][11]

    <h2>May Holidays</h2>
    <h3>May 1 – Labor Day</h3>
    <p>
      International Workers' Day, also called Labour Day in some countries[1] and often referred to as May Day,[2][3] is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement and occurs every year on 1 May,[4][5] or the first Monday in May.[6][7]
      <br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, 1 May is the date of the European spring festival of May Day. The International Workers Congress held in Paris in 1889 established the Second International for labor, socialist, and Marxist parties. It adopted a resolution for a "great international demonstration" in support of working-class demands for the eight-hour day. The date was chosen by the American Federation of Labor to commemorate a general strike in the United States, which had begun on 1 May 1886 and culminated in the Haymarket affair on 4 May. The demonstration subsequently became a yearly event.[5] The 1904 Sixth Conference of the Second International, called on "all Social Democratic Party organisations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the eight-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace".[8]
      <br>
      <br>
      The 1st of May, or first Monday in May, is a national public holiday in many countries, in most cases known as "International Workers' Day" or a similar name. Some countries celebrate a Labour Day on other dates significant to them, such as the United States and Canada, which celebrate Labor Day on the first Monday of September.[9] In 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated 1 May to "Saint Joseph the Worker". Replacing another feast to St. Joseph, this date was chosen by Pope Pius XII in 1955 as a counterpoint to the communist International Workers' Day celebrations on May Day.[10] Saint Joseph is the patron saint of workers and craftsmen, among others.[11][12]

    <h2>June Holidays</h2>
    <h3>June 14 – Independence Day</h3>
    <P>
      This article is about the national holiday. For the day the Philippines gained its independence from the United States, see Republic Day (Philippines).
      <br>
      <br>
      Independence Day of the Philippines[1] (Filipino: Araw ng Kasarinlán; also known as Araw ng Kalayaan, "Day of Freedom") is a national holiday in the Philippines observed annually on June 12,[2] commemorating the declaration of Philippine independence from Spain in 1898.[2] Since 1978, it has been the country's National Day.
      <br>
      <br>
      The earliest recorded event related to the holiday was when Andres Bonifacio, along with Emilio Jacinto, Restituto Javier, Guillermo Masangkay, Aurelio Tolentino, Faustino Manalak, Pedro Zabala, and few other Katipuneros went to Pamitinan Cave in Montalban (now Rodriguez, Rizal) to initiate new members of the Katipunan. Bonifacio wrote Viva la independencia Filipina! or Long Live Philippine independence on walls of the cave after the Spanish discovery of the revolutionary group.[3] Bonifacio also led the Cry of Pugad Lawin, which signals the beginning of the Philippine Revolution. Members of the Katipunan, led by Bonifacio, tore their community tax certificates (cedulas personales) in protest of Spanish conquest.[4][5]
      <br>
      <br>    
      The Philippine Revolution began in 1896. The Pact of Biak-na-Bato, signed on December 14, 1897, established a truce between the Spanish colonial government and the Filipino revolutionaries. Under its terms, Emilio Aguinaldo and other revolutionary leaders went into exile in Hong Kong after receiving $MXN400,000[a] from the Spanish Government.[7]
      <br>
      <br>
      At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Commodore George Dewey sailed from Hong Kong to Manila Bay leading the US Navy Asiatic Squadron. On May 1, 1898, Dewey defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay, effectively placing the Spanish capital under US control. Later that month, the US Navy transported Aguinaldo back to the Philippines.[8] Aguinaldo arrived on May 19, 1898 in Cavite.[9]
      <br>
      <br>
      On June 5, 1898, Aguinaldo issued a decree at his house located in what was then known as Cavite El Viejo proclaiming June 12, 1898 as the day of independence. The Acta de la Proclamacion de la Independencia del Pueblo Filipino was solemnly read by its author, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Aguinaldo's war counselor and special delegate.[10] The 21-page declaration was signed by 98 Filipinos, appointed by Aguinaldo, and one retired American artillery officer, Colonel L. M. Johnson.[11] The Philippine flag was officially unfurled for the first time at about 4:30 p.m, as the Marcha Nacional Filipina was played by the band of San Francisco de Malabon.[12]

    <h2>August Holidays</h2>
    <h3>August 30 – National Heroes Day</h3>
    <p>
      The holiday traces its roots to the Cry of Pugad Lawin in August 1896, which marked the beginning of the Philippine Revolution.[3] The date and the location of the cry have been long disputed. From 1911 to 1962, the cry was thought to have emanated from Balintawak (now in modern-day Balingasa, Quezon City) on August 26.[4] In 1963, by recommendation of historian Teodoro Agoncillo, the date was changed to August 23, and the location was changed to Pugad Lawin in Caloocan (now in modern-day Gulod, Novaliches, Quezon City).[5] Due to the disputed date, and with the consensus that the cry occurred in late August, the holiday was then set for the last week of August.[4]
      <bR>
      <br>
      The observance of National Heroes Day was already present during the American colonial period. Act No. 3827 by the Philippine Legislature enacted on October 28, 1931, designated every last Sunday of August as National Heroes Day.[6] However, Bonifacio Day established by virtue of Act No. 2946 of 1921 was also dedicated to anonymous Filipino heroes.[7] In practice, National Heroes Day celebrations were observed on the same day as Bonifacio Day. This continued during the Japanese occupation during World War II and some years after the United States granted the Philippines independence in 1946.[8]
      <br>
      <br>
      President Elpidio Quirino issued Administrative Order No. 190 in 1952 which reverted National Heroes Day back to the last Sunday of August.[9] Administrative Code of 1987 of President Corazon Aquino designated the day as a regular holiday.[10] The date of the holiday was revised again in 2007, this time to the last Monday of August, via Republic Act No. 9492 which was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.[8][11]

    <h2>November Holidays</h2>
    <h3>November 1 – All Saints’ Day</h3>
    <p>
      All Saints' Day, also known as All Hallows' Day,[3] the Feast of All Saints,[4][5] the Feast of All Hallows,[6] the Solemnity of All Saints,[6] and Hallowmas,[6][7] is a Christian solemnity celebrated in honour of all the saints of the Church, whether they are known or unknown.[7][8][9][10]
      <bR>
      <br>
      From the 4th century, feasts commemorating all Christian martyrs were held in various places,[3] on various dates near Easter and Pentecost. In the 9th century, some churches in the British Isles began holding the commemoration of all saints on 1 November, and in the 9th century this was extended to the whole Catholic Church by Pope Gregory IV.[11]
      <br>
      <br>
      In Western Christianity, it is still celebrated on 1 November by the Western Catholic Church as well as by many Protestant churches, such as the Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist traditions.[7] The Eastern Orthodox Church and associated Eastern Catholic and Eastern Lutheran churches celebrate it on the first Sunday after Pentecost.[12] The Syro-Malabar Church and the Chaldean Catholic Church, both of which are in communion with Rome, as well as the Church of the East, celebrate All Saints' Day on the first Friday after Easter Sunday.[13] In the Coptic Orthodox tradition, All Saints' Day is on Nayrouz, celebrated on 11 September. The day is the start of the Coptic new year, and of its first month, Thout.[14]
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>November 29 – Bonifacio Day</h3>
    <p>
      Bonifacio Day is a national holiday in the Philippines, commemorating Andrés Bonifacio, one of the country's national heroes. He was the founder and eventual Supremo of the Katipunan, a secret society that triggered the Philippine Revolution of 1896 against the Spanish Empire. It is celebrated every November 30, the birth anniversary of Bonifacio. It also coincides with the feast day of Saint Andrew the Apostle, from whom Bonifacio's given name was derived, as he was born on such day.[1][2]
      <br>
      <br>
      Since 1901, Bonifacio's birthday has been celebrated by civic organizations. By 1920, Senator Lope K. Santos filed a bill to declare November 30 a holiday. In 1921, the governor general approved the bill as Act No. 2946.[3] The law did not name Bonifacio and added November 30 to the list of holidays listed at Act No. 2711. In time, it became a holiday to commemorate all Filipino heroes; this persisted even when a separate National Heroes' Day holiday was declared in 1931. In 1942, November 30 was declared as National Heroes' Day. In 1952, by that time, the now-independent Philippines, President Elpidio Quirino separated National Heroes' Day and Bonifacio Day by an executive order.[4] Quirino explained in a speech at the National Teachers College that the "change has become necessary because of the interest from different sectors of our country to celebrate each hero's anniversary in order to perpetuate his name."[5]
      <br>
      <br>
      Unlike Rizal Day which is held on the death anniversary of José Rizal, Bonifacio Day is celebrated on his birth date. This is because of the controversial events on which Bonifacio was executed by his fellow revolutionaries during the time of the Philippine Revolution.[6]

      In 2023, Bonifacio Day was commemorated on November 27, as part of the "holiday economics" strategy that shifts the observance of the holiday to the nearest Monday for a longer weekend by virtue of Proclamation No. 90 under President Bongbong Marcos[7][8] Thus, November 30 was designated as a working day, though traditional celebrations persisted on that day.[9]

    <h3>December 25 – Christmas Day</h3>
    <p>

      <br>
      Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A liturgical feast central to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.

      The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.

      There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth. In the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25, the date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. It is nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the Roman date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, celebrating that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity is more important than knowing Jesus's exact birth date.

      The customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular holiday traditions include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; watching Christmas movies; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; and displaying various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, poinsettias, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. Additionally, several related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.

    <h3>December 30 – Rizal Day</h3>
    <p>
      Rizal Day (Spanish: Día de Rizal, Filipino: Araw ni Rizal; Tagalog: [riˈsal]) is a Philippine national holiday commemorating life and works of José Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines. It is celebrated every December 30, the anniversary of Rizal's 1896 execution at Bagumbayan (present-day Rizal Park) in Manila.
      <br>
      <br>
      Rizal Day was first instituted with a decree dated December 20, 1898, signed by President Emilio Aguinaldo in Malolos, Bulacan, celebrating December 30, 1898, as a national day of mourning for Rizal and all the victims of the Spanish colonial rule of the Philippines.[1][2] Daet, Camarines Norte was the first town to follow the decree, building a monument designed by Lt. Col. Antonio Sanz, led by Sanz and Lt. Col. Ildefonso Alegre, and financed by the townsfolk of Camarines Norte and the rest of the Bicol Region.[1][3] Finished in February 1899, the three-tiered stone pylon inscribing Rizal's novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, and Morga, for Antonio de Morga, author of Sucesos de las islas Filipinas, a book about the early days of the Spanish colonization in the Philippines.[3]

      With the victory of the Americans against the Spaniards in the Spanish–American War, the Americans took control of the Philippines. In an effort to demonstrate that they were more pro-Filipino than the Spaniards, the American Governor-General William Howard Taft in 1901 named Rizal a Philippine national hero. A year later, on February 1, 1902, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 345, which made December 30 a public holiday.[1]
